## 📝 Project Overview

You are tasked to simulate a **smart home IoT environment** by setting up a Raspberry Pi to log sensor data (temperature readings). The project integrates Linux skills including:

- System update and directory organization
- File and directory management
- User, group, and permission management
- Process and network monitoring
- Scripting, automation, and file descriptor management
- Log rotation, scheduling, and archiving

The goal is to create a production-ready setup for IoT sensor data logging.
